# Building RNNs and Transformers using PyTorch

## Description

This project focuses on exploring and implementing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformer models using PyTorch. The aim is to understand the concepts and techniques related to these models like tokenization, word embeddings and positional/segment embeddings, gradient clipping and their application in machine translation.

## Installation
